                Fairies are generally portrayed as humanoid in appearance and as having supernatural abilities such as the ability to fly, cast spells, and to influence or foresee the future. Although in modern culture they are often depicted as young, sometimes winged, females of small stature, they originally were depicted much differently: Tall, radiant, angelic beings or short, wizened trolls being some of the commonly mentioned. </p>  <!--block-->

            Dragons are among the most popular and enduring of the world's mythological creatures.It's not clear when or where stories of dragons first emerged, but the huge, flying serpents were described at least as early as the age of the ancient Greeks and Sumerians. For much of history dragons were thought of as being like any other mythical animal: sometimes useful and protective, other times harmful and dangerous.  <!--inline-->
