                    <p>
                        The shop opened in August 2020. This has been a dream of mine for a long time, because I have
                        been to many of these shops and businesses but cannot seem to find the items and products I
                        would look for. So I decided to open my own shop to sell the products I felt some cunsumers like
                        myself would be interested in buying.

                    <h2>Overview of Paganism</h2>
                    <p>
                        Paganism represents a wide variety of traditions that emphasize reverence for nature and a
                        revival of ancient polytheistic and animistic religious practices. Some modern forms of Paganism
                        have their roots in 19th century C.E. European nationalism (including the British Order of
                        Druids), but most contemporary Pagan groups trace their immediate organizational roots to the
                        1960s, and have an emphasis on archetypal psychology and a spiritual interest in nature.
                        Paganism is not a traditional religion per se because it does not have any official doctrine,
                        but it does have some common characteristics joining the great variety of traditions. One of the
                        common beliefs is the divine presence in nature and the reverence of the natural order in life.
                        Spiritual growth is related to the cycles of the Earth and great emphasis is placed on
                        ecological concerns. Monotheism is almost universally rejected within Paganism and most Pagan
                        traditions are particularly interested in the revival of ancient polytheist religious traditions
                        including the Norse (northern Europe) and Celtic (Britain) traditions. Many Pagan traditions are
                        intentionally reconstructionist in that they aim to revive many of the lost rituals of the
                        ancient traditions, including holy days and seasonal celebrations. Besides Nature, many Pagans
                        also worship a variety of gods and goddesses, including spirits which can represent national and
                        local heroes as well as deceased family members. In this sense, many Pagans try to honor their
                        ancestry and ancestors. Some Pagan traditions include ritual magic, but this practice is not
                        universal.

                        learning
                        about different religions and spirituality until I found one that I felt was good for me. I ama
