                    <h3>Spiraling Inward: Lammas to Samhain During a Pandemic</h3>
                    <p>There is usually a subtle shift in the air that happens in late July or August. It’s a
                        slightly different, cool wind, and a whisper of what is coming. It’s that feeling of Fall
                        being on its way, with summer’s end in sight. This has me simultaneously wistful and
                        excited, as I love summer and yet I also look forward to Samhain. We spiral inward during
                        this time of year, as we head towards the darker part of the year.</p>
                    <p>This year, there is a layer over all of this during this time. COVID-19 shows no sign of
                        ending, and precautions are still in place. The words “back to normal” are fading from our
                        vocabulary, as time marches on, and it’s difficult to make plans, much less think about the
                        future. Each week is a new and unfamiliar territory, or the unrelenting same-ness may be
                        taking its toll.</p>
                    <p>   Part of me surrenders to the unknown, going with the flow, and then there’s a part that
                        holds fast to my practice. It keeps me on task, and helps mark time. This is the time of
                        year where we turn inward, prepare for the colder weather, and reach the culmination of the
                        Wheel of the Year.</p>

                       <p> Just as we cleanse the energy of our homes and our spaces, so too do we cleanse the energy
                        of the stagnant past few months. Begin simply, by lighting a candle, and spending time at
                        your altar. Has it gotten dusty? Clean it off, and start anew. It may still be fresh from
                        Lammas, or perhaps we have lost all sense of time, and items are on there from March. Move
                        the energy at your altar, stand back once you’re done, and savor how you feel.</p>
